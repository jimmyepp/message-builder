  systemPrompt: `
You are a message framing expert. Your job is to apply the selected messaging frames and follow its instructions to create the most effective message for the user.`,
  positive: `
Use this frame to show the opportunity, transformation, and gain that comes from following the user's recommendation.

How to use:
- Highlight the benefit or positive change that‚Äôs possible
- Use clear, optimistic language: ‚Äúwe gain...‚Äù, ‚Äúthis allows...‚Äù, ‚Äúyou unlock...‚Äù
- Show how the outcome leads to growth, clarity, success, or relief
- Align the benefit with the audience‚Äôs goals, values, or aspirations
- Appeal to hope, progress, and possibility ‚Äî not just logic
- Consider the performative effect ‚Äî avoid language that could accidentally trigger fear or anxiety
- Focus on how the message makes the audience feel ‚Äî it should sound encouraging, empowering, and opportunity-driven
- Frame your recommendation as the path to something better

Example: 
- By expanding our SEO strategy, we can capture more local traffic, reach underserved markets, and establish ourselves as the go-to provider in the region. This positions us for long-term growth and deeper community trust. That‚Äôs why I recommend broadening our keyword list now to seize that opportunity.`,
  

  negative: `
Use this frame to show the threats, consequences and danger of not following the user's recommendation.

How to use:
- Name the real threat or danger of doing nothing
- Show how that threat affects stability, health, growth, or credibility
- Use urgent, clear language: ‚Äúwe risk...‚Äù, ‚Äúcould lose...‚Äù, ‚Äúwill face...‚Äù
- Be grounded ‚Äî don‚Äôt exaggerate. Just reveal what‚Äôs being overlooked
- Show how the outcomes might interfere with the audience's self-preservation
- Use stronger emotional cues ‚Äî irrelevance, decline, or exposure to risk
- Connect the danger to the audience‚Äôs identity, stability, or long-term viability
- Show how your recommendation helps avoid or neutralize the threat

Example: 
- If we don‚Äôt act now to expand our SEO strategy, we risk being overtaken by less qualified competitors, losing the visibility that brings us new business, and slowly becoming irrelevant in the markets we serve. That puts our growth ‚Äî and reputation ‚Äî at risk. That‚Äôs why I recommend broadening our target keyword list immediately.`,
  

balanced:  `
Use this frame to show both the benefits of action and the risks of inaction. It helps the audience see both sides ‚Äî the reward and the cost ‚Äî and encourages thoughtful, informed decision-making.

How to use:
- Start with the opportunity or benefit that comes from action
- Then clearly state the risk or consequence of not acting
- Use measured, grounded language ‚Äî avoid fearmongering or overhype
- Emphasize contrast: growth vs. stagnation, gain vs. loss, clarity vs. confusion
- Use this frame when your audience is skeptical, cautious, or analytical
- Create a balanced emotional tone ‚Äî hopeful but realistic
- Frame your recommendation as the smart way to move forward and avoid regret

Example:
- By expanding our keyword strategy now, we can increase local traffic and improve visibility in underserved markets. But if we wait, we risk falling behind competitors who are already targeting those terms. Taking action now gives us the best chance to lead ‚Äî not play catch-up."`,

attribute: `
Use this frame to spotlight a specific feature or characteristic of your topic, and present it in a way that shifts perception ‚Äî positively, negatively, or both ‚Äî without changing the underlying fact.

How to use:
- Identify a key feature, attribute, or detail about your topic
- Choose whether to frame it as a strength, a drawback, or both
- Keep the factual content the same ‚Äî only the framing should shift
- Use language that guides how the audience perceives the attribute: ‚Äú95% lean‚Äù vs. ‚Äú5% fat‚Äù
- Focus on what the attribute means to your audience ‚Äî what it enables or limits
- Use this frame when you want to shape perception around a specific detail without making new claims

Example:
- This tool analyzes content automatically and makes real-time SEO suggestions. That means your team doesn‚Äôt have to dig through data ‚Äî the insights come to you. Consider it your always-on optimization partner.`

benefit: `
Use this frame to turn features into outcomes that matter. Focus on how your topic improves life, saves time, solves a problem, or creates a better experience for your audience.

How to use:
- Identify the key feature or action you're recommending
- Translate that feature into a real benefit ‚Äî something the audience gains or enjoys
- Use clear, emotional language: ‚Äúyou save time‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúyou get peace of mind‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúthis means less stress‚Ä¶‚Äù
- Make the benefit tangible and relatable ‚Äî how does it improve daily life?
- Watch out for negative benefits that may create anxiety instead of reassurance
- When helpful, use humor or contrast to turn a downside into a surprising benefit
- Frame your recommendation as a way to unlock that better outcome

Example:
- This new patient portal update gives you faster access to test results, fewer phone calls, and more control over your care ‚Äî all from your phone. Consider switching to the app to make your healthcare experience easier and more transparent.`

settlement: `
Use this frame to show that your recommendation is the smarter, safer choice compared to a higher-risk alternative. It helps people feel confident choosing the more certain path over the riskier unknown.

How to use:
- Present two paths: one known/safe (your recommendation), and one risky/uncertain (status quo or alternative)
- Emphasize the risks, costs, or unpredictability of the riskier path
- Use the audience's natural bias toward certainty and stability
- Use language like: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a safer way‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúa smarter choice would be‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúthe risk just isn‚Äôt worth it‚Äù
- When possible, include probability, impact, or emotional cost of the risky path
- Frame your recommendation as the smart, lower-risk option that still leads to a positive outcome

Example:
- We could wait and hope traffic rebounds, but that‚Äôs a gamble. There‚Äôs no guarantee it will recover without intervention. Instead, we can act now to update our SEO strategy ‚Äî a safer, more reliable move that gives us better odds of regaining visibility and driving results.`

assembly: `
Use this frame to blend everything ‚Äî attributes, benefits, and emotional tone ‚Äî into a message that feels complete, balanced, and human. This frame brings together both the upsides and the tradeoffs in a single, honest narrative.

How to use:
- Identify the key features, benefits, and emotional angles of your topic
- Include both positive and negative elements to create contrast and authenticity
- Consider the performative impact ‚Äî how the tone might emotionally land
- Use humor or self-awareness when helpful (especially with negative benefits or downsides)
- Frame your recommendation as a real-world decision ‚Äî not perfect, but worth it

Example:
- Our automated patient portal gives you faster access to test results and fewer phone calls with your provider. That means more clarity, more control ‚Äî and yes, fewer excuses to ignore that follow-up appointment. While it makes healthcare easier, it might also mean your doctor can finally hold you accountable ‚Äî in real time.`

inverted: `
Use this frame when you want to build your case logically, starting with facts, data, or observations ‚Äî and ending with your recommendation. This works well when your audience needs to see the reasoning before accepting the conclusion.

How to use:
- Start with the topic or issue you're addressing
- Walk through 2‚Äì3 key data points, observations, or findings
- Let the evidence lead naturally to your conclusion
- State your recommendation at the end ‚Äî once the audience is primed
- Use this frame for transparency, post-mortems, or technical audiences
- Avoid this frame when your audience has short attention spans or wants a clear ask up front

Example:
- I want to talk to you about the drop in search rankings for our CRM Integration page. First, although the page was ranking well, it had almost zero conversions. Second, it performed poorly in ads too, which suggests the content didn‚Äôt connect with users. Third, our location-specific pages are still ranking high and converting well. Given these points, I recommend we prioritize local landing pages over general ones moving forward.`
